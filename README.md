<h3>Objective</h3>
  <p>
  Designing a mechanism for processing EEG signals and analyze the bands present in the EEG signals for predicting epilepsy and depression. 
  Comparing three different Machine learning namely Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes and Random Forest Classifiers to solve the problem.
  </p>

<h3>Data</h3>
  <p>
  Ten subjects of “CHB-MIT Scalp EEG” database is used for analysing the
  introduced feature. The database used, consists of EEG recordings from paediatric
  subjects with intractable seizures. Recordings were collected at “Children’s
  Hospital Boston”. All signals were sampled with 16-bit resolution at 256 sampling
  rates. The international 10-20 system of EEG electrode positioning was used for
  recording. The task is to divide EEG signal into quasi-stationary segments.
